Type Constraints terrafom variables

Type constraints control the type of variable values



* Primitive (Single type value)
number, string, bool

Exemples:

replicas = 3
name     = "Cluster2"
backup	 = true

* Complex (Multiple types in a single variable)
list, tuple, map, object

Exemple

Variable with multiple values assign

var = prod, 2, vpc


The complex types can be broken in two types

First: 
Collection, types allow multiple vlues of one primitive type to be grouped together

Contructors ofr these Collections include:

* list(type) strings
* map(type) numbers
* set(type) strings



Exemple of Collections


Variable will be a list of several Strings


variable "training" {
	type 	= list(strings)
	default = ["ACG", "LA"]  ## to separate strings inside one variable
}


Second:

Complex types - Structural

Structural types allow multiple values of different primitive types to be grouped together

Constructors for these Collections include

- object(type)
- tuple(type)
- set(type)

More than one type o value into a variable


vaiable "instructor"{
	name = string        #Primative types
	age  = number        #Several named attributes
}

Object type containing several variables within



Dinamic Types = THe "ANY" constraint

ANY is a placeholder for a primitive type yet to be decided
Actual type of a variable will be determined by at runtime by terraform


variable "data"{
	type = list(any)
	default = [1, 42, 4]
}

Terraform will recognizes all values as numbers in one variable
