Terraform Cloud (Sumary)

Colaboration oriented Terraform workflow.

- remote terraform execution
- version control integration (github, bitbucket e etc)
- workspace based organization base model
- remote state management and cli integration, 
- Private terraform module registry, API UI and cli based acces.
- cost estimation( AWS, GCP and azure only) and sentinel integration features.







Terraform does not automatically back up your configuration to Terraform Cloud. If you are running Terraform locally, it stores the configuration in the designated directory on your machine.


Though Terraform Cloud integrates and can use repositories like GitHub and BitBucket, it does not have version control built in.
