Terraform workspaces (cli)

The terraform workspaces are alternate statefiles within the same working directory

Terraform starts with a single workspace that is almays called DEFAULT. It cannot be deleted.


terraform workspace new <WORKSPACE-NAME>    (create a workspace)
terraform workspace select <WORKSPACE-NAME>  (select a workspace)

Scenario:

Test changes using a parallel, distinct copy of insfrastructure.
It can be modeled against branches in version control such as Git.



Each workspace tracks a separate independent copy of the state file.

Terraform will deploy a new envirolment for each workspace, you can test a diferent envirolment using the same code.


Workspace are ment to share resources and to help enable collaboration between teams.


Access to a workspace name is provided through the ${terraform.workspace} variable.



Example 1:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = terraform.workspace == "default" ? 5 : 1
  # ... other arguments

}

Example 2:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket"{
  bucket = "myxzbucket-${terraform.workspace}"
  acl    = "private"
}
