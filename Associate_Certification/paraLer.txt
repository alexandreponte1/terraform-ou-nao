Explicação

The terraform apply -replace command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource for replacement, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the apply execution.

You could also use terraform destroy -target <virtual machine> and destroy only the virtual machine and then run a terraform apply again.


IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ

This command replaces terraform taint, which was the command that would be used up until 0.15.x. You may still see terraform taint on the actual exam until it is updated.
